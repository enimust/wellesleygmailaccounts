# Google accounts in a Meteor app

Simple Meteor app to demonstrate use of Gmail accounts.

This is a simple app that makes use of Google accounts. The goal was to show how to configure accounts-google.
Detailed instructions to do that are in the lecture notes: http://cs.wellesley.edu/~mashups/pages/meteor6.html.

This project has the "autopublish" on, thus, it has security issues in terms of being able
to access all users information on the client side. 

The live instance for the app can be found here: http://wellesleygmailaccounts.meteor.com/.
